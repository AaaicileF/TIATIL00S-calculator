# TIATIL00S-calculator

even-better-calc is my latest file with the updates for the calculator that had a keypad 3x4.
4x4keypad-calc-text(oneday-work) is the second file I made for the new keypad that I didn't had time setting up.
This is also the reason I didn't have time to make a short film of how it was working, sadly I don't have any pictures either...
